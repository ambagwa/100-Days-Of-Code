## Day 3 : June 6, 2024

**Today's progress**: I finished working on my mini project, MyWeatherApp. Started working on another mini project for retrieving information about a movie based on the title of the movie. I am using the OMDb API.

**Thoughts**: From the two APIs I have worked with, the api_key need to come as the last parameter of the api_url. If it is placed before other parameters, an error 401 is returned.

## Day 16 : June 21, 2024

**Today's progress**: Revised regular functions or regex and some of its  flags. Also revised on the split() method that I used to create an array of charaacters from a string. I also checked on the reverse() method of arrays which reorders the elements of an array. Also checked on the join() method which combines all array elements into a single string.

**Thoughts**: Array methods make it easier to work with and manipulate strings.

**Link to work**: ___

## Day 17: June 23, 2024

**Today's progress**: Learnt more about regular expressions. Solved a freeCodeCamp project for checking if a word or phrase is a palindrome, even if it contains spaces, special characters, or even uppercase letters.

**Thoughts**: Different flags of regex have more than one function. Consider "^", which can be used in more than one scenario.

## Day 21 : June 27, 2024

**Today's progress**: I checked whether the user's search input is part of my predefined inventory and if yes, the details of the book are returned. I also implemented how to access the book objects.

**Thoughts**: Accessing objects is easy

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day 22 : June 28, 2024

**Today's progress**: I added new books to localStorage. Also checked if a book exists in localStorage before adding it.

**Thoughts**: localStorage is perfect for saving small bits of data.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day 23 : June 30, 2024

**Today's progress**: Created a new function that I used to add a book that is not already in the books object. A user is given a platform that the user provides the book details and adds them to the books object. 

**Thoughts**: Functions makes it easier to reuse code. 

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day 24 : July 1, 2024

**Today's progress**: Added more functionalities to the project: Checked a book against localStorage too. Also started working on how I will display all the books in localStorage through a button.

**Thoughts**: Solving bugs is relaxing

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day 25 : July 2, 2024

**Today's progress**: I implemented a new function that, through a button, "Display inventory", the user can see all the books in localStorage. All these books are displayed in a table. I also implemented a function that cleared a specific book from localStorage and removes them from the table.

**Thoughts**: Finally got ahold of arrays and objects.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day  26 : July 3, 2024

**Thoughts**: Debugging. Fuekss

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day 27 : July 4, 2024

**Today's progress**: I auto-inremented stock number when a user added a new book to the inventory. I also modified the collectBookDetails(). I also managed to tick all teh requirements I had while designing this project. 

**Thoughts**: console.log() comes in handy when debugging

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day 28 : July 5, 2024

**Today's progress**: I went back to my previous project, MyShoppingPage, to implement more functionality. I started working on a new (), removeItem(), that allows a customer to remove an individual item from the cart. This is done through a button that is added when a customer add an item to the cart.

**Thoughts**: The OO aspect of JS is effective and makes code reusable.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/MyShoppingPage

## Day 29 : July 6, 2024

**Today's progress**: Based on the last modification, only the first item on the cart would be removed. I am working on how to remove all the items individually.

**Thoughts**: Code's functionality is fragile

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/MyShoppingPage

## Day 30 : July 7, 2024

**Today's progress"": i successfully removed items from the cart individually. I impemented extra methods, removeItemEventListener() and updateRemoveButtons(), to enable this. I also learnt of more JS methods while at it: bind() which creates a new function with a this predefined value, and split() method which splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified operator. I also learnt about event bundling, which is like a chain of events, from the child triggering an event, till the document object. 

**Thoughts**: Working on mini projects really helps at rasping and understanding concepts.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/MyShoppingPage

## Day 31: July 8, 2024

**Today's progress**: I reminded myself of  the filter() method which returns an array. I also implemented a functionality where a user can search for a particular shoe based on its name.

**Thoughts**: Haba na haba hujaza kibaba

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/MyShoppingPage

## Day 32 : July 9, 2024

**Today's progress**: I searched by shoe category on the searchBtn functionality. I started to learn Bootstrap which takes a mobile-first approach whiledeveloping websites. Bootstrap is used to enhance the responsiveness of a webpage. I learnt that Bootstrap has pre-defined classes for styling elements. 

**Thoughts**: functions are great

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/MyShoppingPage

## Day 33 : July 10, 2024

**Today's progress**: I went through Bootstrap docs and learnt od the different ways to create responsive columns during different classes. I also learnt of the different grid tiers: extra small, small, medium, large, extra large, and extra extra large.

**Thoughts**: Responsiveness is easily implemented with Bootstrap.

## Day 34  : July 11, 2024

**Today's progress**: I looked into Bootstraps form controls and how the classes form-control is used for input elements. I also learnt how the class form-text is used to create bock-level and inline-level form text. I also learnt that  the disabled attribute can be used on input element too as well as the read ony attribute.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap makes it so easy to style html.

**Link to work: ___

## Day 35 : July 12, 2024

**Today's progress**: I learned more about file input's in Bootstrap and also the color input. I aso learnt how to incorporate datalists into inputs. I also started learning about jQuery and how it makes HTML document manipulation easier. This is enabled throgh a browser running functions while oading your page. Some of these functions include addClass(), removeClass(), css(), appendTo(), html(), remove(), clone(), and parent().

**Thoughts**: Who knew how life was before Bootstrap and jQuery?

**Link to work**: __

## Day 36 : July 13, 2024

**Today's progres I learnt about the containers in Bootstrap and how they are categorized into 3 classes: .container, .container-{breakpoint}, and .container-fluid. I also started learning about navigation bars. I learnt about some of the supported content i.e .navbar-brand for company or project name, .navbar-nav, .navbar-toggler for toggling behavior, .navbar-text, and .collapse .navar-collapse fo rhiding navbar among others.

**Thoughts**: How did I not know the exploration of documentation?

**Link to work**: Not yet

## Day 37 : July 14, 2024

**Today's progress**: I learnt more about how to add brands, texts, and images inside navigation bars. I also learnt about how to include forms inside navigation bars. 

**Thoughts**: Day 38 is something

**Link to work**: Still reading the docs

## Day 38 : July 15, 2024

**Today's progress**: I learnt of the different color schemes that can be associated with the navigation bars. I also learnt of the different placement schemes for the nav element i.e. fixed-(top and bottom) and sticky-(top and bottom). I also learnt how to enable vertical scrolling on the navbar together with the offcanvas navbars.

**Thoughts**: I thibk offcanvas navbars look great

**Link to work**: Still on the documentation

## Day 39 : July 16, 2024

**Today's progress**: I learnt of how Sass in incoroporated with Bootstrap. I learnt variable declaration in Sass, Sass functions and their arguments, colors and color modes, and components.

**Thoughts**: Sass makes it easier for reusing code.

**Link to work**: Documentation things

## Day 40 : July 18, 2024

**Today's progress**: I looked into gutters. Their function is to add a padding between columns and are used to responsively space and align itemsby adding a padding-left and a padding-right on each column. They also use a negative offset to remove the padding at the start and the end of each columns of a row. I also learnt that horizintal gutters are effected using .gx-* class while the .gy-* class is used for vertical guttering. 

**Thoughts**: Gutters might consume more space

**Link to work**: Still on documentation.

## Day 41 : July 19, 2024

**Today's progress**: I also learnt of the class .g-* which combines both the horizontal and vertical gutters. Gutters can also cause overflows hence the need to use .overflow-hidden class in case it occurs. The class .g-0 is used to remove all gutters. I also learnt of the display property, of the naming convantions i.e. .d-{value} for extra small screens and .d-{breakpoint}-{value} for sm - xxl screen sizes. I also learnt of hiding elements using the .d-none 0r .d-{breakpoint}-none classes on an eleent. You can also show an element on a given interval of screen sizes by combining one -f .d-*none with a .d-*-*classes. Bootstrap also provide printing displays that is either relevant for screen viewing or printing or both via the classes .d-none or .d-print-{value} or both. I also looked into flexbox options. Most of the options provided responsive variations across different screen sizes. The utilities include justify-content, align-items, align-self, flex-fill, flex-grow, flex-shrink, order, wrap, align-content, and centering content vertially on its container (media object). I also learnt how to create gaps between rows and columns of the same flex container using .row-gap-* and .col-gap-* classes. I also learnt how to toggle visibility using the .visible and .invisible classes on elements. Visibility elements still affect the layout of the page.Bootstrap included a separate grid system thats built on CSS grid and demands the default grid system to be disabled using $enabled-grid-classes: false. The CSS grid is enabled by $enable-cssgrid: true;. Instances of .row are replaced with .grid and instances of columns are replaced with .g-col-*. .g-start-* class is a  shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end. Auto columns are used when there are no grid classes on the grid items.CSS grid also allows for nesting of grids. Local css variables: --bs-rows, --bs-columns, --bs-gap also customize the number of rows, number of columnns, and width of the gap between columns respectively.

**Thoughts**: CSS makes a lot of sense now

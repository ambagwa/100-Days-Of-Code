# Movies-Retrieval-App

## Key features : 

### - fetch API implementation. Based on the user's input, the fetch API returns movie information.
### - Pagination. If the returned movies are less than 6, the "More results" button is hidden. If the results are more than six, the button pops up and once clicked, the next six batch of results are shown. If there are no more results, the button gets hidden again.

## Some tips:

#### - The url to the API has some parameters, with the following two being tricky to comprehend:

#####	- t : Used to search for a movie by its title. The information returned is for a specific movie.

#####	- s - Used to search for multiple movies based on a search query. A list of movies is returned by the API.

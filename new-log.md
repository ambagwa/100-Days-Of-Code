# 100 Days of Code challange

## Day 0: June 3, 2024

**Today's progress**: Reminded myself the basics of arrays in JS. Learnt about array methods such as find(), reverse(), and shift().

**Thoughts**: Arrays are a great way to store large data in a structured way. The data can also be easily accessed and manipulated.

## Day 1: June 4, 2024

**Today's progress**: Learnt the difference between function calls and function references. I also  got to learn about the Fetch API which is used to make network requests to a server. I discovered how requests are handled, whether successful or unsuccessful.

**Thoughts**: Function references work best in some scenarios where function calls would not work as needed.

**Link to work**: ___

## Day 2: June 5, 2024

**Today's progress**: Started working on a project, MyWeatherApp, that would display the different weather conditions of different cities. The weather details were sourced using openweathermap API.

**Thoughts**: The way in which fetch works mahes it easy to detect any errors. It provides specific details about the errors making it easier to solve them.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/myWeatherApi

## Day 3 : June 6, 2024

**Today's progress**: I finished working on my mini project, MyWeatherApp. Started working on another mini project for retrieving information about a movie based on the title of the movie. I am using the OMDb API.

**Thoughts**: From the two APIs I have worked with, the api_key need to come as the last parameter of the api_url. If it is placed before other parameters, an error 401 is returned.

## Day 6 : June 9, 2024

**Today's progress**: Implemented localStorage where any fetched data is stored in localStorage. Even after reloading, the stored data is retrieved and displayed on the page before a user fetches another set of data

**Thoughts**: localStorage improves user interaction. 

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/MyMoviesRetrievalApp

## Day 7 : June 10, 2024

**Today's progress**: Learnt about a different way of implementing asynchronous programming. Continued to explore fetch API, Promises, Async/await, and try...catch statement.

**Thoughts**: Asynchronous programming improves efficiency and responsiveness.

**Link to work**: Still learning

## Day 8 : June 11, 2024

**Today's progress**: Learnt about git rebasing to solve an issue I experienced while pushing my code to github.

**Thoughts**: Rebasing makes it easier to resolve conflicts.

## Day 16 : June 21, 2024

**Today's progress**: Revised regular functions or regex and some of its  flags. Also revised on the split() method that I used to create an array of charaacters from a string. I also checked on the reverse() method of arrays which reorders the elements of an array. Also checked on the join() method which combines all array elements into a single string.

**Thoughts**: Array methods make it easier to work with and manipulate strings.

**Link to work**: ___

## Day 17: June 23, 2024

**Today's progress**: Learnt more about regular expressions. Solved a freeCodeCamp project for checking if a word or phrase is a palindrome, even if it contains spaces, special characters, or even uppercase letters.

**Thoughts**: Different flags of regex have more than one function. Consider "^", which can be used in more than one scenario.

**Link to work**: https://www.freecodecamp.org/settings#cert-responsive-web-design

## Day 18 : June 24, 2024

**Today's progress**: I managed to clean up a project for converting a number to its roman equivalent. This reminded me of how for and while loops work. I also got to understand assignment operators better.

**Thoughts**: Objects make it easier to manipulate data.

**Link to work**: https://www.freecodecamp.org/settings#cert-javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8

## Day 19 : June 25, 2024

**Today's progress**: Learnt about the promise object which  represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

**Thoughts**: Promises are cleaner and are used as an alternative to traditional call back functions

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/MyShoppingPage

## Day 20 : June 26, 2024

**Today's progress**: I completed the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures certification and started working on a new project. I also got to learn of how to include an icon on the title bar of a website.

**Thoughts**: Its the small wins the are fuelling me.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day 21 : June 27, 2024

**Today's progress**: I checked whether the user's search input is part of my predefined inventory and if yes, the details of the book are returned. I also implemented how to access the book objects.

**Thoughts**: Accessing objects is easy

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day 22 : June 28, 2024

**Today's progress**: I added new books to localStorage. Also checked if a book exists in localStorage before adding it.

**Thoughts**: localStorage is perfect for saving small bits of data.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day 23 : June 30, 2024

**Today's progress**: Created a new function that I used to add a book that is not already in the books object. A user is given a platform that the user provides the book details and adds them to the books object. 

**Thoughts**: Functions makes it easier to reuse code. 

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day 24 : July 1, 2024

**Today's progress**: Added more functionalities to the project: Checked a book against localStorage too. Also started working on how I will display all the books in localStorage through a button.

**Thoughts**: Solving bugs is relaxing

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day 25 : July 2, 2024

**Today's progress**: I implemented a new function that, through a button, "Display inventory", the user can see all the books in localStorage. All these books are displayed in a table. I also implemented a function that cleared a specific book from localStorage and removes them from the table.

**Thoughts**: Finally got ahold of arrays and objects.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day  26 : July 3, 2024

**Today's progress**: I worked on a few errors I had. Implemented a new function for validating the form inputs. Also deleted a book from books object

**Thoughts**: Debugging. Fuekss

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day 27 : July 4, 2024

**Today's progress**: I auto-inremented stock number when a user added a new book to the inventory. I also modified the collectBookDetails(). I also managed to tick all teh requirements I had while designing this project. 

**Thoughts**: console.log() comes in handy when debugging

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/book_inventory_management

## Day 28 : July 5, 2024

**Today's progress**: I went back to my previous project, MyShoppingPage, to implement more functionality. I started working on a new (), removeItem(), that allows a customer to remove an individual item from the cart. This is done through a button that is added when a customer add an item to the cart.

**Thoughts**: The OO aspect of JS is effective and makes code reusable.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/MyShoppingPage

## Day 29 : July 6, 2024

**Today's progress**: Based on the last modification, only the first item on the cart would be removed. I am working on how to remove all the items individually.

**Thoughts**: Code's functionality is fragile

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/MyShoppingPage

## Day 30 : July 7, 2024

**Today's progress"": i successfully removed items from the cart individually. I impemented extra methods, removeItemEventListener() and updateRemoveButtons(), to enable this. I also learnt of more JS methods while at it: bind() which creates a new function with a this predefined value, and split() method which splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified operator. I also learnt about event bundling, which is like a chain of events, from the child triggering an event, till the document object. 

**Thoughts**: Working on mini projects really helps at rasping and understanding concepts.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/MyShoppingPage

## Day 31: July 8, 2024

**Today's progress**: I reminded myself of  the filter() method which returns an array. I also implemented a functionality where a user can search for a particular shoe based on its name.

**Thoughts**: Haba na haba hujaza kibaba

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/MyShoppingPage

## Day 32 : July 9, 2024

**Today's progress**: I searched by shoe category on the searchBtn functionality. I started to learn Bootstrap which takes a mobile-first approach whiledeveloping websites. Bootstrap is used to enhance the responsiveness of a webpage. I learnt that Bootstrap has pre-defined classes for styling elements. 

**Thoughts**: functions are great

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/MyShoppingPage

## Day 33 : July 10, 2024

**Today's progress**: I went through Bootstrap docs and learnt od the different ways to create responsive columns during different classes. I also learnt of the different grid tiers: extra small, small, medium, large, extra large, and extra extra large.

**Thoughts**: Responsiveness is easily implemented with Bootstrap.

**Link to work**: __

## Day 34  : July 11, 2024

**Today's progress**: I looked into Bootstraps form controls and how the classes form-control is used for input elements. I also learnt how the class form-text is used to create bock-level and inline-level form text. I also learnt that  the disabled attribute can be used on input element too as well as the read ony attribute.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap makes it so easy to style html.

**Link to work: ___

## Day 35 : July 12, 2024

**Today's progress**: I learned more about file input's in Bootstrap and also the color input. I aso learnt how to incorporate datalists into inputs. I also started learning about jQuery and how it makes HTML document manipulation easier. This is enabled throgh a browser running functions while oading your page. Some of these functions include addClass(), removeClass(), css(), appendTo(), html(), remove(), clone(), and parent().

**Thoughts**: Who knew how life was before Bootstrap and jQuery?

**Link to work**: __

## Day 36 : July 13, 2024

**Today's progres I learnt about the containers in Bootstrap and how they are categorized into 3 classes: .container, .container-{breakpoint}, and .container-fluid. I also started learning about navigation bars. I learnt about some of the supported content i.e .navbar-brand for company or project name, .navbar-nav, .navbar-toggler for toggling behavior, .navbar-text, and .collapse .navar-collapse fo rhiding navbar among others.

**Thoughts**: How did I not know the exploration of documentation?

**Link to work**: Not yet

## Day 37 : July 14, 2024

**Today's progress**: I learnt more about how to add brands, texts, and images inside navigation bars. I also learnt about how to include forms inside navigation bars. 

**Thoughts**: Day 38 is something

**Link to work**: Still reading the docs

## Day 38 : July 15, 2024

**Today's progress**: I learnt of the different color schemes that can be associated with the navigation bars. I also learnt of the different placement schemes for the nav element i.e. fixed-(top and bottom) and sticky-(top and bottom). I also learnt how to enable vertical scrolling on the navbar together with the offcanvas navbars.

**Thoughts**: I thibk offcanvas navbars look great

**Link to work**: Still on the documentation

## Day 39 : July 16, 2024

**Today's progress**: I learnt of how Sass in incoroporated with Bootstrap. I learnt variable declaration in Sass, Sass functions and their arguments, colors and color modes, and components.

**Thoughts**: Sass makes it easier for reusing code.

**Link to work**: Documentation things

## Day 40 : July 18, 2024

**Today's progress**: I looked into gutters. Their function is to add a padding between columns and are used to responsively space and align itemsby adding a padding-left and a padding-right on each column. They also use a negative offset to remove the padding at the start and the end of each columns of a row. I also learnt that horizintal gutters are effected using .gx-* class while the .gy-* class is used for vertical guttering. 

**Thoughts**: Gutters might consume more space

**Link to work**: Still on documentation.

## Day 41 : July 19, 2024

**Today's progress**: I also learnt of the class .g-* which combines both the horizontal and vertical gutters. Gutters can also cause overflows hence the need to use .overflow-hidden class in case it occurs. The class .g-0 is used to remove all gutters. I also learnt of the display property, of the naming convantions i.e. .d-{value} for extra small screens and .d-{breakpoint}-{value} for sm - xxl screen sizes. I also learnt of hiding elements using the .d-none 0r .d-{breakpoint}-none classes on an eleent. You can also show an element on a given interval of screen sizes by combining one -f .d-*none with a .d-*-*classes. Bootstrap also provide printing displays that is either relevant for screen viewing or printing or both via the classes .d-none or .d-print-{value} or both. I also looked into flexbox options. Most of the options provided responsive variations across different screen sizes. The utilities include justify-content, align-items, align-self, flex-fill, flex-grow, flex-shrink, order, wrap, align-content, and centering content vertially on its container (media object). I also learnt how to create gaps between rows and columns of the same flex container using .row-gap-* and .col-gap-* classes. I also learnt how to toggle visibility using the .visible and .invisible classes on elements. Visibility elements still affect the layout of the page.Bootstrap included a separate grid system thats built on CSS grid and demands the default grid system to be disabled using $enabled-grid-classes: false. The CSS grid is enabled by $enable-cssgrid: true;. Instances of .row are replaced with .grid and instances of columns are replaced with .g-col-*. .g-start-* class is a  shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end. Auto columns are used when there are no grid classes on the grid items.CSS grid also allows for nesting of grids. Local css variables: --bs-rows, --bs-columns, --bs-gap also customize the number of rows, number of columnns, and width of the gap between columns respectively.

**Thoughts**: CSS makes a lot of sense now

**Link to work**: Still on documentation

## Day 42 : July 20, 2024

**Today' progress**: Still under CSS Grid, grid items lacking grid classes are resized automatically. The number of columns and gaps can however be adjusted using --bs-rows and --bs-gaps respectively. --bs-rows style is used to add rows to a grid item and is placed on the grid container while grid-row is used to determine the row that accommodates a specific grid item. row-gap style allows one to modify the vertical gap. One can also use the --bs-gap style in 2 ways: 1 value for all sides or two values for vertical and horizontal respectively. I also learnt of Reboot which is  a collection of element-specific CSS changes that normalize  and reset some browser styles  for an elegant, consistent, aand simple baseline to build upon. This includes but not all, normalizing font sizes using rem, resets margin and paddings, consistent box-sizing, and resets forms, links, lists, tables, and forms.

**Thoughts**: Reboot offers more control but just really depends on one

**Link to work**: Still on documentation

## Day 43 : July 22, 2024

**Today's progress**: I started learning Botstrap's typography. .display-* makes your heading standout when added to yourheading element. .lead makes paragraphs stand out from the normal ones. .mark represents highlighted text, .small for side-comments and small print, .text-decoration-underline, and .text-decoration-line-through. .initialism adds a smaller font size to <abbr>. .blockquote is wrapped around <blockquote> to quote block of content from another source within your element. .blockquote-footer works in conjunction with the <cite> element the same way a figcaption element does with the figure element. .list-unstyled removed the default list styling and left margin for the immediate child list items. .list-inline and .list-inline-item removes a list's bullets and adds a slight margin. The grid system is used to align text and description horizontally on dl. I also learnt about bootstraps images. .img-fluid ensures the responsiveness of an image and .img-thumbnail adds a 1px borderline on the image. Image aligning is enabled through helper float classes or text alignment classes. I also started looking into tabless. Bootstrap's tables are opt-in, .table class is added to <table> to adopt Botstrap's table styling. Use contextual classes to color tables, table-rows, and individual cells. .table-striped adds a zebra-stripping to rows inside <tbody>. .table-striped-columns have the same zenra-stripes on columns. .table-hover adds a hover effect on table rows that are inside tbody element. .table-active adds a highlight to a table row or table cell. .table-bordered adds a border around a table and its cells while border color utilities add color to the border. .table-borderless creates a table without borders. .table-sm creates a small table with reduced padding. .table-group-divider adds a thicker darker border between table groups. .align-* vertically align the tables contents. Nested tables do not inherit border styles, active styles, and table variants. <caption> provides a tag for a table and ,caption-top places the caption at the top of the table. I also looked into forms: .form-select is the default class for select menus while .form-select-{sm/lg} chooses small or large text inputs respectively. I also looked in range input. .form-range creates a custom <input type="range">. 

**Thoughts**: Typography makes it easier to arrange your page to your liking>

**Link to work**: Still on the documentation.

## Day 44 : July 23, 2024

**Today's progress**: I started learning about input groups which are initiated using .input-group with .input-group-text as its child element. Form sizing classes are enabled by adding .input-group-{sm/lg} on .input-group. For radios and checkboxes, place them withing an input group's addon and give the .form-check-input for appropriate styling. Multiple <input>s are supported visually but validation is only done to the iput groups with only 1 <input>. Other addons that are supported include: buttons, buttons with dropdowns, and segmented buttons. I also started looking into float labels. Bundle up and a lable inside a .form-floating to enable floating labels. The placeholder wont be shown inside the input , but rather the label will be shown. .is-invalid is added to .form-control to validate the form. .form-floating also supports textareas with labels. Disabled boolean attribute is also supported. .form-control-plaintext together with the attribute readnoly creates a readonly plaintext. Floating labels also support input groups. I also deved into layout. I learnt that margin utilities are the easiest way to structure forms. Grid classes can build more complex forms. Gutter classes have control over the gutter width btn columns. .row creates horizontal forms when added to the grid. .col=form-label-{sm/lg} follows the size of .form-control-{sm/lg} while working with <label> and <legend>.Flexbox utilities vertically centers contents. I also started looking into Bootstrap's validation which is used to provide valuable, actionable feedback on forms. novalidate boolean attribute is added to <form> as well as .needs-validation which are combined to form Bootstrap's custom validation. .valid-feedback is also created to hold validation feedback.. I also started looking into Bootstrap's validation which is used to provide valuable, actionable feedback on forms. novalidate boolean attribute is added to <form> as well as .needs-validation which are combined to form Bootstrap's custom validation. .valid-feedback is also created to hold validation feedback.

**Thoughts**: Input groups make it easier to bundle up forms.

**Link to work**: Still working on documentation. 

## Day 45 : July 24, 2024

**Today's proress**: Under form validation still, .has-validation is added to .input-group to provide a containerfor the browser's default validation features. The class .is-invalid and .is-valid are used to show the feedback messages without server side scripting. aria-describedby ensures the feedback is associated with the relevant form field. .{valid/invalid}-feedback can be substituted with .{valid/invalid}-tooltip for a styled feedback message. I also delved into accordions which are vertical collapsible elements that allow you to show and hide content by clicking on a header. They help organize content into expandable sections. .accordion is placed on a parent element that hosts .accordion-item children. .accordion-flush is added to .accordion to remove some borders and rounded corners to render accordions edge-to-edge with their parent container. Omit data-bs-parent to make the accordion items stay open when another item is opened. O also looked into Bootstrap's alert and how it provides contextual feedback messages via its .alert and .alert=* classes. .alert creates the alert box while .alert-* styles the alert box. Alerts can also be customized with icons using flexbox utilities and Bootstrap's icons. You can also dismiss an alert inline using an alert JS plugin that adds a button to the alert. I also looked into badges which are initialized using .badge. An additional class, .text-bg-secondary is added to style the badge and its contents. Badges can also be used as part of links or buttons to provide a counter. The position of the badge may also be adjusted using utilities. .text-bg-{color} sets a background color with a contrasting foreground color. .visually-hidden adds text that aaids with accessibility. .rounded-pill adds a borderr radius to a badge. 

**Thoughts**: Accordions have smooth animations

**Link to work**: Still working on documentation.

## Day 46 : July 25 , 2024

**Today's progress**: I learnt about breadcrumbs which which shows a user's location within a website's hierarchy. .breadcrumb applies Bootstrap's styling for breadcrumbs while .breadcrumb-item applies styling for breadcrumb's items. A local CSS inline style, --bs-breadcrumb-divider is used to add a divider to the breadcrumb. I also delved into buttons which are declared using .btn class which adds basic styling to buttons. The class is used with other button variants, or to serve as a basis for your own custom styles. .text-nowrap disables text wrapping inside a button. .btn classes can also be used on <a> elements but only for inpage functionaity. Replace .btn-* class with .btn-outline-* for a button with no background color. Create a smaller or larger button using .btn-{sm/lg}. disabled attribute is used to make a button inactive and for the case of a link, the href attribute is done away with and .disabled class added. Create block buttons for easier control over responsiveness using .d-grid class. I also looked into button groups where you can stack your buttons vertically or align them together horizontally. Wrap a series of buttons with .btn in .btn-group. Combine sets of button groups into button toolbars using .btn-toolbar for more complex components. Add .btn-group-{sm/lg} to a button group to apply a size to each button inside the button group. One can also nest button groups. .btn-vertical-group makes buttons appear vertically stacked rather than horizontally. I also leart about cards and how .card provides a class for styling cards. .card-body sets the building block of a card. Titles, links and subtitles are supported through .card-title, .card-link, and .card-subtitle respectively. Content supported on the cards include: body, titles, subtitles, text, links, images, list groups, headers, and footers. Cards can be wrapped in columns and rows using grid. Replace .card-body with .card-img-overlay to use an image as the card's background. 

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap makes things eaasier to work with.

**Link to work**: Still on documentation.

## Day 47 : July 26, 2024

**Today's progress**: Contiued delving into cards. .text-bg-{color} sets a background color to the card with a contrasting foreground color. Use .text-{color} to customize the color of the text and use .border-{color} to set the border color of the card. .card-body is used to render a group of cards as single, attached element, with equal width and height elements. Use the grid system and .row-cols-* classes to control how many grid columns you want in a row. Add .h-100 to each card for a consistent height for all the cards. 

**Thoughts**: Mansory makes grids interesting

**Link to work**: Documentation things

## Day 48 : July 27, 2024

**Today's progress**: I started looking into Bootstrap Carousel. .carousel initiates a container for the carousel items. .carousel-inner holds carousel items and .carousel-item contains a single slide. .carousel-control-{prev/next} are added to buttons to navigate to the previous or next buttons respectively. .carousel-control-{prev/next}-icon are  added to the buttons to show the navigation icons. .visually-hidden is addded fr accessibility purposes. .carousel indicator, alongside controls allow users to jump directly to the slides they want. .carousel-fade allows for smoother transitions and data-bs-ride="true" autoplays the carousel on page transition. If the ride option is set to true, the autoplay will only start after the first user interaction. The attribute data-bs-touch="false" si used to disable touch swipping on touchscreen devices. 

**Thoughts**: Animaations are made better with Bootstrap

**Link to work**: Still on documentation

## Day 49 : July 29, 2024
**Today's progress**: Implemented Bootstrap's card layout on a project I had previosly started. I also looked into Bootstrap's close button which is initialized using .close-button and an aria-label for accessibility. I also looked into Bootstrap's collapse which hides/shows content via a button or a <a> link that acts as a button. Both require the data-bs-target="collapse> attribute. Horizontal collapsing is also supported via adding .collapse-horizontal to the .collapse element. Multiple button and link elements can also toggle the same element if they each reference it with the data-bs-target and href attribute. Referencing can also be done using the class selector for several elements. I started looking into dropdown which are toggleable , contextual overlays for displaying lists of links. The dropdown's toggle and ropdown menu are wrapped within .dropdown. For proper spacing around the dropdown caret, add .dropdown-toggle-split to .dropdown-toggle. Button dropdowns work will buttons of all sizes, .btn-lg and .btn-sm. .dropdown-menu-dark is added to .dropdown-menu for a darker menu. However, there is no need for this as the whole page can be set to dark mode via data-bs-theme="dark" that us added to the html tag. 

**Thoughts**: Mansory is kinda technical with vanill JS

**Link to work**: https://github.com/ambagwa/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/MyShoppingPage

## Day 50 : July 30, 2024

**Today's progress**: Still on dropdowns, I learnt that the menus maybe be positioned differently using the classes, .dropdown-center, .dropup, .dropup-center, .dropend, and .dropstart. The menu items may also use <a> or <button> elements. .dropdown-item-text is used to create non-interactive menu items. If you want to use responsive alih=gnment, you disable dynamic positioning by using data-bs-display="static" on the dropdown element and then use .dropdown-menu-{breakpoint}-end/start for either right or left alignment. Use .dropdown-header together with any heading to create a header for the list items. Use .dropdown-divider + <hr> t separate groups of related menu items. data-bs-offset and data-bs-reference are used to change the location of the dropdown. data-bs-auto-close attribute is added to the dropdown element to dictate how to close the menu. I also started looking into list groups which are used to display a series of content. The most commo is an ul which is classed .list-group and its contents, .list-group-item. Add .list-group-item-action to .list-group-item to create actionable items with hover, disabled, and active states fr links and buttons. .list-group-flush is used to remove some borders and rounded corners to render the list group items edge-to-edge in a parent container. <ol> together with .list-group-numbered are used to create numbered list items. .list-group-horizontal is used to make the list group's layout span from left to right. .list-group-horizontal-{breakpoint} is the responsive variant for the latter and the horizontal effect takes place from the breakpoints minimum width. Add badges to any list group item with the help of spacing utilities. Any html content can be added to a list group. I also looked into modals which add dialogs for lightboxes, user notifications, or custom content. .modal creates a container while .modal-dialog creates a container for the modal content. .modal-content has the actual modal content inclusive of .modal-header, modal-body, and .modal-footer. Add .fade to .modal for a fade-in animation while displaying the modal. Use the attributes data-bs-backdrop and data-bs-keyboard to restrick closing the modal from outside it. Add .modal-dialog-scrollable to .modal-dialog to create a scrollable modal that allows scrolling the modal body. Add .modal-dialog-centered to .modal-dialog to vertically center the modal. data-bs-toggle="popover/tooltip" are used to add tooltips and popovers inside modal bodies. Utilize the Bootstrap grid system within a modal by esting .container-fluid within the .modal-body and then use the normal grid system as you wish. 

**Thoughts**: Dropdown or navbar for section linkage?

## Day 51 : July 31, 2024

**Today's progress**: Still on madals, data-bs-whatever attribute is used to pss additional info to the modal when it opens. I also looked into navbars. .navbar is a base class for creating a navbar. .navbar-expand-{breakpoint} expands the navbar from the breakpoint upwards. .navbar-brand styles the logo or brand inside the navigation bar. .navbar-toggler creates a button that toggles the collapse of a navbar'c content. .navbar-toggler-icon is added inside a button to to create a visual icon for the button. .collapse creates a collapsible section within a navbar while .navbar-collapse provides specific styling for the collapsible content. .navbar-nav creates a list of navigation items inside a navbar. .nav-item creates individual list items inside a navbar. .nav-link provides styling for navigation links while .active might be added for selected links. If your navbar is a form, use the <form> element as the container fuid and use input groups as they are supported too. Various buttons are also supported where you can use vertical alignment utilities to align different sizeed elements. .navbar-text is used to display text within a navbar. Use data-bs-theme attribut + .bg-* utility to customize the color of the navbar. Wrap .navbar inside a .container to center the navbar on a page. Use spacing utilities for placing the navbars on the DOM. .navbar-nav-scroll is added to .navbar-nav to enable vertical scrolling within the toggleable contents of a collapsed navbar. .collapse is used to create collapsible content sections.

## Day 52 : August 1, 2024

**Today's progress**: I started looking into Bootstrap's navs and tabs. Tabs are initialized using .nav which is built with flexbox. .nav-item define the list item for the navigation link. .nav-link styles the navigation links. .disabled and .active are also supported with the support of aria-disabled="true" and aria-current="page" respectively for assistive technologies. Use flexbox utilities to change the horizontal alignment of your nav. For vertical alignment, use .flex-column utilities. Vertical slignment is also supported responsively using .flex-{breakpoint}-column class. Tabs takes the normal nav and add .nav-tabs for a tabbed interface. Create pill-shaped tabs by adding .nav-pills to .nav. Create underlined navs by adding .nav-underline to .nav class. Use .nav-fill to force the .nav elements contents to extend the full available width appropriately. For equal width elements, use .nav-justififed. Consider a series of flex-box utilities for responsive nav variations. If you are using navs to provide a navigation bar, add the role="navigation" attribute to the most logical parent container. Dropdown menus are also supported in navs and tabs. I also looked into offcanvas. These are hidden sidebars that are toggled to appear form aany side of the viewport. Share some similarities with modals. Buttons or anchors are used as triggers. .offcanvas defines the main offcanvas element. .offcanvas-header defines the header section for the offcanvas. Inside the .offcanvas-header, .offcanvas-title defines the title of the offcanvas and .btn-close with data-bs-dismiss attribute defines a close buttn for the offcanvas. .off-canvas-body defines the main content area for the offcanvas. .offcanvas hides content by default while .offcanvas.show displays it. Use the data-bs-scroll attribute to enable body scrolling when an offcanvas and its backdrop are visible. The attribute data-bs-backdrop="static" ensures the offcanvas is only closed by clicking inside it. Offcanvas responsive classes hide content from the breakpoint downwards but display content upwards of the breakpoint. The position of an offcanvas element is determined by .offcanvas-{start/end/top/bottom} classes. 

**Thoughts**: Who ever thought its quite interesting going through docs?

## Day 53 : August 2, 2024

**Progress**: I looked into Bootstrap's Pagination Which is a way for creating links for navigating through a series of related content. I also looked into Placeholders which show loading components or pages. links for navigating through a series of related content. I also looked into popovers which are interactive and floating elements that appear when triggered on a page. I also looked into Progress Bars which typically show progress. Ia lso looked into scrollspy. This provides a way of updatig navigation based on the scroll position .

**Thoughts**: Accessibiity caters for everyoune on the web

## Day 54 : August 3, 2024

**Progress**: I also looked into toasts which act as an alert message to users and can be used to welcome them. .toast creates a toast wrapper container which encloses a .toast-header and .toast-body. .toast-cantainer is used to stack up several toasts. Color and background utilities create different color schemes on the toast. Use custom CSS to place toasts where you need them.

## Day 55 : August 5, 2024

**Progress**: I looked into positioning which determine the positioning of an element and its options include: sticky-{top/bottom} and fixed-{top/bottom}. Responisiveness is also supported in the format .fixed-{breakpoint}-top for all the classes. I also looked into ratios which make elements maintain their aspect ratios of your choosing. Initialized using .ratio and .ratio-16x9. I also looked into stacks which is used to determine the layout of components. .vstack is used for vertical layouts while .hstack is used for horizontal layouts. I also looked into stretched links which make anelement clickableby adding a "stretching" nested link via .stratched-link. Text truncation is enabled by .text-truncate on .d-block and d-inline-block elements. Use .vr class to create a vertical rule. I also looked into background utilities which are useed to set a background color to an element using .bg-{color} and .bg-{color}-subtle for a lighter color. .bg-gradient is added to .bg-info for a linear background gradient.  Opacity is also supported via .bg-opacity-{values}. Use .border to add borders to an element or target a specific side using .border-{top,end,bottom,start}. Add .border-0 to .border to remove all borders or .border-{side}-0 to remove a border on a specific side. Border colors are set by adding .border-{color} or .border-{color}-subtle to .border. .border-opacity-{value} is used to determine the opacity of the border color. .border-{value} sets aa border's width. .rounded creates a border radius to all corners while .rounded-* sets a border color to targeted areas. You can also scale down with .rounded-* with sizes from 0-5. .float-* toggles float on any element. This however affects the layout of the page therefore use clearfix helper to eliminate this. Responsiveness is also supported in the following format .float-{breakpoint}-start/end/none. .user-select-{none/all/auto} determines the way in which content is selected when the user interacts with it.

## Day 56 : August 6, 2024
 
**Progress**: I also studied link utilities. .link-opacity-* is used to change the alpha opacity of the link while .link-opacity-*-hover changes the opacity when hovering over the link. .link-underline-* changes the color of the underline of a link. .link-offset-* is used to set the distance between the text and link underline. .link-underline-opacity-*  is added to .link-underline to change the underline's opacity. I also looked into object-fit which is used to scale elements such as <img> and <video> into their containers via .object-fit-*. Responsiveness is also supported in the format .object-fit-{breakpoint}.*. Control the opacity which is the transparency of an element using .opacity-{value} class. I also looked into how overflow content should be treated using .overflow-*. I also looked into element positioning which is initiated using the class .position-*. .translate-middle centers elements. I also looked into shadows which is enabled using .shadow or .shaadow-{sm/lg} and remove shadows using .shadow-none. I also looked into sizing and how the .w-* and .h-* classes are used to set the widths and heights of elements respectively. I also looked into spacing. Use gap utilities on the parent element while using display: {flex/grid}. .row-gap and .column-gap are used to set the vertical and horizontal spaces between children items in a container. Text alignment is done through .text-* and .text-{breakpoint}-* for responsiveness. .text-wrap is used to wrap text. Use .fs-{value} to change the foont size of text. .fst-* and .fw-* change the font style and font weight of text respectively. .lh-* changes the line height of text.  

**Thoughts**: Cant wait to implement Bootstrap in my projects

**Link to work**: Coming soon.

## Day 57 : August 7, 2024

**Progress**: I looked into vertical alignment utilities which are initialied with the class .align-*. The utilities only work on inline, inline-block, inline-table, and table elements. I also looked into z-index utilities which are used to change the stack level of elements . They require a position value other than static and are initialized using .z-* class which is added to .position-* class. I also started iplementing Bootstrap into a project of mine

**Thoughts**: Implementation makes understanding way better.

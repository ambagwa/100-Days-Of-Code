## My-Shopping-Page

### This project aims at creating a market place with a scalable page for adding new items. This is implemented using objects in JS. The web app reloads all the products onto the page, The images are also preloaded so that they are all added at once. Each product has an add-to-cart button for adding the product to the shopping cart.

### The shopping cart :

####   - stores the products added to it. It takes the product name, its quantity, and the price of each prduct.

####   - adds the subtotal of the items

####   - Calculates VAT on the products

####   - Displays the total after adding

####   - A user can also anipulate a product's quantity directly on the shopping cart.

####   - also has allows a user to remove a product from the cart

### A button, clear cart, is also appeded on the shopping cart to clear the cart when a user wants to. There also is another button to hide/display cart.

### A user can also clear the cart.

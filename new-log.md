# 100 Days of Code challange

## Day 0: June 3, 2024

**Today's progress**: Reminded myself the basics of arrays in JS. Learnt about array methods such as find(), reverse(), and shift().

**Thoughts**: Arrays are a great way to store large data in a structured way. The data can also be easily accessed and manipulated.

## Day 1: June 4, 2024

**Today's progress**: Learnt the difference between function calls and function references. I also  got to learn about the Fetch API which is used to make network requests to a server. I discovered how requests are handled, whether successful or unsuccessful.

**Thoughts**: Function references work best in some scenarios where function calls would not work as needed.

## Day 2: June 5, 2024

**Today's progress**: Started working on a project, MyWeatherApp, that would display the different weather conditions of different cities. The weather details were sourced using openweathermap API.

**Thoughts**: The way in which fetch works mahes it easy to detect any errors. It provides specific details about the errors making it easier to solve them.

## Day 3 : June 6, 2024

**Today's progress**: I finished working on my mini project, MyWeatherApp. Started working on another mini project for retrieving information about a movie based on the title of the movie. I am using the OMDb API.

**Thoughts**: From the two APIs I have worked with, the api_key need to come as the last parameter of the api_url. If it is placed before other parameters, an error 401 is returned.

# 100 Days of Code challange

## Day 0: June 3, 2024

**Today's progress**: Reminded myself the basics of arrays in JS. Learnt about array methods such as find(), reverse(), and shift().

**Thoughts**: Arrays are a great way to store large data in a structured way. The data can also be easily accessed and manipulated.

## Day 1: June 4, 2024

**Today's progress**: Learnt the difference between function calls and function references. I also  got to learn about the Fetch API which is used to make network requests to a server. I discovered how requests are handled, whether successful or unsuccessful.

**Thoughts**: Function references work best in some scenarios where function calls would not work as needed.

## Day 2: June 5, 2024

**Today's progress**: Started working on a project, MyWeatherApp, that would display the different weather conditions of different cities. The weather details were sourced using openweathermap API.

**Thoughts**: The way in which fetch works mahes it easy to detect any errors. It provides specific details about the errors making it easier to solve them.

## Day 3 : June 6, 2024

**Today's progress**: I finished working on my mini project, MyWeatherApp. Started working on another mini project for retrieving information about a movie based on the title of the movie. I am using the OMDb API.

**Thoughts**: From the two APIs I have worked with, the api_key need to come as the last parameter of the api_url. If it is placed before other parameters, an error 401 is returned.

## Day 4 : June 7, 2024

**Today's progress**: Continued working on my project.

**Thoughts**: HTML and CSS might look simple but needs practice and attention just like any other language while learning them.

## Day 6 : June 9, 2024

**Today's progress**: Implemented localStorage where any fetched data is stored in localStorage. Even after reloading, the stored data is retrieved and displayed on the page before a user fetches another set of data

**Thoughts**: localStorage improves user interaction.

## Day 7 : June 10, 2024

**Today's progress**: Learnt about a different way of implementing asynchronous programming. Continued to explore fetch API, Promises, Async/await, and try...catch statement.

**Thoughts**: Asynchronous programming improves efficiency and responsiveness.

**Link to work**: Still learning

## Day 8 : June 11, 2024

**Today's progress**: Learnt about git rebasing to solve an issue I experienced while pushing my code to github.

**Thoughts**: Rebasing makes it easier to resolve conflicts.

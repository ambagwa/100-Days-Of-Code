## My-Shopping-Page

### This project aims at creating a market place with a scalable page for adding new items. This is implemented using objects in JS rather than hardcoding them in HTML.

### The project also has a shopping cart that :

####   - stores the products added to it

####   - adds the subtotal of the items

####   - Calculates VAT on the products

####   - Displays the total after deducting VAT

### A user can also clear the cart.
